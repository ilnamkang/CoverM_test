### CoverM test
This repository is for understanding the "relative_abundance" calculation method of CoverM more clearly. For various calculation methods of CoverM, refer to <https://github.com/wwood/CoverM#calculation-methods>.

Main purpose is to analyze what would happen to the relative abundance of a specific genome, if I include other genomes with variable sizes that recruit variable number of metagenome reads.

CoverM_Test.Rmd is the main file for the analysis.\
CoverM_Test.html is just the knitted version of the Rmd file.\

This analysis is for my own purpose, and may have errors.
