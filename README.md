### CoverM test
This repository is for understanding the "relative_abundance" calculation method of CoverM more clearly. For various calculation methods of CoverM, refer to <https://github.com/wwood/CoverM#calculation-methods>.

My main purpose is to analyze what would happen to the relative abundance of a specific genome, if I include other genomes with variable sizes that recruit variable number of metagenome reads.
