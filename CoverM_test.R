# This script is for understanding the "relative_abundance" calculation method of CoverM more clearly.
# For various calculation methods of CoverM, refer to https://github.com/wwood/CoverM#calculation-methods.

# I want to calculate the relative abundance of genome A.
# I'd like to know what would happen to the relative abundance of genome A,
# if I include other genomes with variable sizes that recruit variable number of metagenome reads.

library(tidyverse)

## Metagenome
tot_reads <- 1000 # Total reads = 1000
read_len <- 100 # Length of each read = 100 bp # To make it simple, assume that all reads have the same length.

## Genomes
# Genome A (our focus)
size_A <- 1000 # Genome size = 1000 bp
mapped_reads_A <- 10 # mapped reads = 10
mapped_bases_A <- mapped_reads_A * read_len # To make it simple, assume that all matches are perfect.
avg_cov_A <- mapped_bases_A / size_A

# Genome B, C, and D (other genomes)
# Sizes are different.
size_B <- 500 # size = 500 bp (smaller than A)
size_C <- 1000 # size = 1000 bp (equal to A)
size_D <- 2000 # size = 2000 bp (larger than A)

## Genome sets
# Genome set includes Genome A and one other genome B|C|D.

## Analysis
# number of metagenome reads mapped to the other genomes (B|C|D) is a variable.
# The same range of numbers is used for the three genomes.
mapped_reads <- 0:100

# Create a table following the calculation method of CoverM.
